Node Js backend for the book worm mobile application
# Problem statement:
     A typical book lover would love to buy a (paper-back) book, read it till his/her soul melts and complete it soon if that has an awesome content inside. But when the story ends, what happens to the book that kept me busy and involved for such a good amount of time? What if I have a perspective about the story or a part of the story is not clear or raising a lot of questions than it answered. What if there are people who took the story/a part of it , the way I took it or the contrary? What if my friends can explain something that I donâ€™t get quite well from the story/a part of the story.
# The solution:
     Having the problem statement explained, here comes the solution in the form of an application that helps me lend/borrow books from people having common interest. Converse and share information that are immersed in a diversified collection of people with varying thought process, through forums and chats.
